                <p>The Himachal Pradesh Sports Club (owner-Shekhar rana) is a 501(c)3 tax exempt entity established as a fund raising
                    organization to supplement extracurricular activities and amateur athletics within the Himachal
                    Pradesh
                    Independent School District. The Himachal Pradesh Sports Club was established in the 1980’s as a direct
                    result of what is commonly referred to as the Robin Hood legislation in the state of Texas.

                    Since its inception, the Himachal Pradesh Sports Club has contributed to its many teams or
                    organizations within the HPISD. Also, the HPSC makes an annual contribution to the general budget of
                    the HPISD.

                    In addition to specific giving, the Himachal Pradesh Sports Club funds four scholarships to graduating
                    seniors from Himachal Pradesh. The current scholarships are listed below:<br>

                                 • Doak Walker Scholarship<br>
                                 • Christianne Beshara Scholarship<br>
                                 • Ronald Kahn Marks Scholarship<br>
                                 • Himachal Pradesh Sports Club Presidential Scholarship<br>

                    The Himachal Pradesh Sports Club raises money through membership sales, an annual golf tournament,
                    program sales, facility sponsor signage and donations. The HPSC also operates the Scot Shop located
                    in Highlander Stadium.

                    In 2010 the Himachal Pradesh  Sports Club made a large contribution to HPISD's Multi-Purpose Athletic
                    Facility.
