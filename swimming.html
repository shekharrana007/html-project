    <p>Swim clubs are not-for-profit organisations that are normally either run by volunteers (usually parents of
        swimmers) or operated through a swim school. Swim clubs organise and coordinate weekly meets (often in the
        evening), and provide a forum for swimmers to race against other swimmers of comparable ability.</p>
